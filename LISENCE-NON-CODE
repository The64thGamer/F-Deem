          THE OH FUNNY LISENCE
        Version 1, Nov 1, 2024.

This lisence pertains to the use of non-code aspects
of Oh Funny Horse, including the 3D models for pieces,
the name, the branding, and anything considered a
copyrighted material pertaining to the work.

All of these aspects, just as with the software itself,
are lisenced under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
This lisence is viewable in the LISENCE file under the
same directory as this file. All uses must include this
lisence alongside the GNU GPL v3.0.

Examples of uses are but not limited to:

  1. Redistributing any current OFH piece made.
  2. Distributing modified pieces.
  3. Distributing new user-made OFH branded pieces.
  4. Distributing instructions for buildable sets
     using OFH pieces.
  5. Distributing any other product using the
     OFH brand.

Just as software under the GNU GPL v3.0. needs to be
open sourced, other uses will need to be openly
accessible to users. As it pertains to pieces,
the model files should be openly available to use.
Instructions should be openly available to view.

Other physical products created should also have
a reasonable way to help users recreate them. 
For example, a plush product is produced. The 
manufacturer would need to provide:

  1. List of materials used to make the plush.
  2. Embroidery machine design files.
  3. Fabric patterns for the shape.
  4. General instructions for creating the plush.

Even if the item is generally out of reach for a
standard user to make, such as an injection-molded 
figure or a machine cut metal piece, the same steps should
be taken.
